## Model-T

Is a [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) app to visualize the variability in [sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)) from a population and how a [t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test) use those samples to approximate what is happening in the actual population.

The app is hosted [here](https://nathanday.shinyapps.io/modelT/).
